This library, based on Adafruit's library at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SHARP_Memory_Display
is designed to drive a SHARP Colour Memory Display. 

The code has additionally been modified to run on an Arduino Due - 32-bit, not 8-bit registers are used.
Delays have been added in some places to comply with the timing specifications.









The original README is reproduced below.




This is an Arduino library for our Monochrome SHARP Memory Displays

These displays use SPI to communicate, 3 pins are required to  
interface
